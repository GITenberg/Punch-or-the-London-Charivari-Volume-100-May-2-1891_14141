    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <h4>[CONTINUED.]</h4>

    <p><i>Thursday, April 16</i>.&mdash;On looking through my book
    I find that I am now a member of ten Billsbury Cricket Clubs,
    to most of which I am a Vice-President. Not bad, considering
    that my average in my last year at school was four, and that I
    didn't play more than half-a-dozen times at Oxford. TOLLAND
    says there are many more Foot-ball Clubs than Cricket
    Clubs&mdash;a pleasant prospect for me in the Autumn. Have also
    had to subscribe to six Missions of various kinds, four Easter
    Monday <i>Fêtes</i>, six Friendly Societies, three Literary and
    Scientific Institutes, five Temperance Associations, four Quoit
    Clubs, two Swimming Clubs, seven Sunday Schools, five Church or
    Chapel Building Funds, three Ornithological Societies, two
    Christian Young Men's Associations, three Children's Free
    Dinner Funds, one Angling Association, not to speak of Fire
    Brigade, Dispensaries, and Brass Bands. Have also given a Prize
    to be shot for by Volunteers, as CHUBSON gives one every year.
    What with £80 subscription to the Registration Fund, things are
    beginning to mount up pretty considerably.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/205-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/205-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Have spoken at three meetings since the Mass Meeting.
    TOLLAND said, "You needn't refer to Sir THOMAS CHUBSON
    yourself. Leave our people to do that. They enjoy that kind of
    thing, and know how to do it." They do, indeed. At our last
    meeting, HOLLEBONE, the Secretary of the Junior Conservative
    Club, went on at him for twenty minutes in proposing resolution
    of confidence in me. "Sir THOMAS," he said, "talks of his
    pledges. The less Sir THOMAS says about them the better. I
    can't walk out anywhere in Billsbury for two minutes without
    tripping over the broken fragments of some of Sir THOMAS's
    pledges. It's getting quite dangerous. Sir THOMAS, they say,
    made himself. It's a pity he couldn't put in a little
    consistency when he was engaged on the job. We don't want any
    purse-proud Radical knights to represent us. We want a
    straightforward man, who says what he means; and you'll agree
    with me, fellow-townsmen, that we've got one in our eloquent
    and popular young Candidate."</p>

    <p>This went down very well. Next day, however, the
    <i>Meteor</i> "parallel-columned" Sir THOMAS CHUBSON's career
    and mine. Mine occupied six lines; Sir THOMAS's "Life of
    honourable and self-sacrificing industry" ran to nearly a
    column. "It will be observed," said the <i>Meteor</i>, "that
    there is a good deal of blank space in Mr. PATTLE's comparative
    career; but this no doubt recommends him to his Conservative
    friends, who are quite equal to filling it brilliantly with
    their imaginative rhetoric about his chances of success."</p>

    <p>Primrose Day, the day after to-morrow. We're going to have a
    great demonstration at Billsbury. Mother is going down with me
    to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>April 20th, "George Hotel," Billsbury</i>.&mdash;The
    Demonstration yesterday was a splendid success. At ten o'clock
    in the morning the Conservative Band marched up to the Hotel
    and played patriotic airs under the window. Mother and I drove
    to the Beaconsfield Club in an open carriage and pair, escorted
    by the band. Mother's bonnet was all primroses, and she carried
    an immense bouquet of them. <i>Carlo</i> came with us and sat
    on the back-seat. His collar was stuck full of primroses, and
    small bunches were tied on to the tufts on his back and at the
    end of his tail. I wore a buttonhole of primroses, and carried
    a huge primrose wreath to be placed round the bust of LORD
    BEACONSFIELD, which stands in the hall of the Club. The
    coachman and horses too were all tricked out with bunches.
    TOLLAND and CHORKLE, and all the leaders of the Party, met us
    at the entrance of the Club, and the ceremony of depositing the
    flowers all round the bust began. CHORKLE, who once shook hands
    with DIZZY in the lobby of the House, made a great speech,
    mostly composed of personal reminiscences of our great departed
    leader. (By the way CHORKLE has six children, five of them
    being sons, whose names are BENJAMIN DISRAELI CHORKLE, CECIL
    SALISBURY CHORKLE, STRAFFORD THOROUGH CHORKLE, HOBBES LEVIATHAN
    CHORKLE, and RANDOLPH CHURCHILL CHORKLE.) The sixth, eighteen
    months old, is a girl. Her name is WILLIAMINA HENRIETTA SMITH
    CHORKLE. They were all present, covered with primroses. I added
    a few words about the inspiring effect that the contemplation
    of LORD BEACONSFIELD's career must have upon the youth of the
    country. Mother's bouquet kept falling off the place she had
    put it on, and two or three enthusiasts always dashed forward
    to pick it up, causing a good many collisions. In the middle of
    my speech, <i>Carlo</i> walked into the centre of the hall, sat
    down and proceeded to gnaw off the primroses which had been
    tied to his tail. He then ate them all solemnly, and after that
    rolled over on his back with his paws stuck straight out,
    pretending he was dead. I must tell Mother not to bring that
    dog again. There was a great banquet in the evening. VULLIAMY
    came down for it and spoke very kindly about me in his speech.
    Said he had followed my career with profound interest and
    pleasure from my earliest years. I've only known him a
    year.</p>

    <h4>(<i>Extract from the Diary of</i> PRIVATE ATKINS,
    <i>Prince's Company, 4th Battalion, H.M.'s Guzzlebeer
    Guards.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Joined the Regiment. Appeared on
    Parade, and was requested to come to "attention," although the
    Sergeant <i>must</i> have seen that I was "standing at ease."
    Expressed a desire that the Commanding-officer should rectify
    the mistake, when all ended amicably. Sergeant apologised, and
    promised that it should not occur again. Satisfied. Both
    Sergeant and Commanding-officer well up in their duties!</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Bugle sounded too early for Assembly.
    Sent a message to the Adjutant by his orderly (with my
    compliments) saying that I would feel much obliged if the
    Parade were postponed an hour. Adjutant returned <i>his</i>
    compliments, with a request that I would give in writing my
    reason for desiring a delay. Explained (by word of mouth) that
    I wanted to read the newspapers. Parade consequently postponed
    as requested. Obliging chap the Adjutant!</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Warned for Guard. Sent for the Major
    of my half-battalion (don't like bothering the
    Commanding-officer about every trifle), and explained that,
    although the Surgeon had seen me, and reported me fit, I had a
    presentiment that the easterly winds would play the very
    mischief with me if I went "Sentry Go." Major thought, perhaps
    it would be better if I were struck off duty. Excused Guard in
    consequence. Good sort Major of my half-battalion!</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Sorry to find rations very
    unsatisfactory. Complained to the Officer of the day, who
    reported the matter to the Captain. Captain said he would have
    asked the entire company to dine with him at his Club had he
    not been engaged. He then passed us on to his Subs. The latter
    most obligingly gave us some food at a Restaurant.
    <i>Châteaubriand</i> excellent, <i>Sole à la Normande</i>
    decent, but <i>Potage à la bisque</i> too rich. Mistake to
    order the latter, as one can never get it <i>really</i> good,
    except on the Continent. Wine tol-lol. Pol Royer of '84.
    However, spent a very pleasant evening. Both Subs, when you
    know them, not half bad fellows!</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Rather a head, and felt generally out
    of sorts. Warned for Kit-inspection. Couldn't stand this, so
    called upon General Commanding District. Not at home, but was
    asked would I see his <i>locum tenens</i>? Replied in the
    negative, as I don't believe in go-betweens. Didn't return to
    barracks, as I thought I might get a breath of sea-air at
    Southend.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Arrested and conveyed to the
    Guard-room. Suppose I shall be released with a caution. At any
    rate, for the present, diary confiscated.</p>

    <h2>SOMEBODY'S LUGGAGE.</h2>

    <p>In view of the intense public excitement aroused by the
    statement that Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, in his expedition to
    Mashonaland, is only going to take two books with
    him&mdash;SHAKSPEARE and MOLIÈRE&mdash;an Inquiring
    Correspondent has recently written to several eminent persons
    on this subject, and has received&mdash;so he says&mdash;the
    following replies:&mdash;</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;You ask me what books I should take if I were
    contemplating a visit to the Dark Continent, like Lord RANDOLPH
    CHURCHILL. The question, in the abstract, and without reference
    to my own personality, is an interesting one, and no doubt
    human fallibility would, in the case you suppose, induce me to
    take several volumes of my own <i>Gleanings</i> with
    me,&mdash;not so much for their intrinsic merits, as because
    perhaps they might form a new kind of literature for native
    African potentates. HOMER, too, <i>of course</i>. At my time of
    life, however, I must be excused from grappling with any new
    Continents, dark or otherwise. I find that Ireland is quite
    dark enough for me just now. Excuse a card. Yours, W.E.
    GL-DST-NE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;As I am not "contemplating an expedition to the
    Dark Continent," and have no sympathy with Hottentots, there
    seems to be no sufficient reason for my answering your
    questions, or for your asking them. S-L-SB-RY.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Your question is ridiculous. The only books worth
    taking to Africa, or anywhere else, would be a bound copy of
    last year's <i>Review of Reviews</i>, GENERAL BOOTH's
    epoch-making volume, and&mdash;this is indispensable&mdash;SIR
    C. D-LKE's invaluable <i>Problems of Greater Britain.</i> When
    I went to Rome, I naturally took with me the "hundred best
    books in the world." They were a little heavy, but I thought
    the POPE would like to see them. However, circumstances
    prevented my presenting them to His Holiness. Yours, W.T.
    ST-D.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I don't know much about books. I've just written
    rather a good one on <i>Cricket</i>, and I think if I were
    going to Africa I should take a supply. From all I've heard of

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Having consulted my relatives&mdash;also CAPTAIN
    M-L-SW-RTH&mdash;as to whether there would be any impropriety
    in giving a reply to your questions, I am happy to say that
    they seem to think there would be none, but that on the
    contrary it might even assist the takings at the Aquarium. I
    may therefore mention that if I were proceeding to Central
    Africa there is <i>only one book</i> I should dream of taking
    with me. That would be a copy of the Proceedings of the London
    County Council, since the joyful date of its advent on this
    planet. Yours obediently, Z-o.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The one book I should take with me to Africa
    would be DR. PETERS' recent valuable work&mdash;<i>More Light
    on Dark Africa</i>. I should give it to the Dwarfs. It would
    make capital poisoned arrows. H.M. ST-NL-Y.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The only book worth thinking about for such an
    expedition as you mention would be STANLEY's <i>In Darkest
    Africa</i>. Its Maps would be invaluable,&mdash;as presents for
    a rival explorer, whom one might desire to mislead as to his
    route. CARL P-T-RS.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>looking out, and shouting</i>). How do you
    do, Judge? (<i>Aims at him.</i>) Mind yourself! [<i>She
    fires.</i></p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>entering</i>). What the devil! Do you
    usually take pot-shots at casual visitors? [<i>Annoyed.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Invariably, when they come by the back-garden.
    It is my unconventional way of intimating that I am at home.
    One does do these things in realistic dramas, you know. And I
    was only aiming at the blue sky.</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. Which accounts for the condition of my hat.
    (<i>Exhibiting it.</i>) Look here&mdash;<i>riddled</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Couldn't help myself. I am so horribly bored
    with TESMAN. Everlastingly to be with a professional
    person!</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). Our excellent TESMAN
    is certainly a bit of a bore. (<i>Looks searchingly at
    her</i>.) What on earth made you marry him?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Tired of dancing, my dear, that's all. And
    then I used TESMAN to take me home from parties; and we saw
    this villa; and I said I liked it, and so did he; and so we
    found some common ground, and here we are, do you see! And I
    loathe TESMAN, and I don't even like the villa now; and I do
    feel the want of an entertaining companion so!</p>

    compartment&mdash;(<i>confidentially</i>)&mdash;the tried
    friend, and, generally speaking, cock of the walk!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>audibly drawing in her breath</i>). I

    looking into LÖVBORG's new book. Wonderfully
    thoughtful&mdash;confound him! But I must go and dress for your
    party, Judge. [<i>He goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. I wish I could get TESMAN to take to politics,
    Judge. Couldn't he be a Cabinet Minister, or something?</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. H'm!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A short pause; both look at one another, without
        speaking. Enter</i> GEORGE, <i>in evening dress, with
        gloves.</i></p>

    <p><i>George</i>. It is afternoon, and your party is at
    half-past seven&mdash;but I like to dress early. Fancy that!
    And I am expecting LÖVBORG.</p>

        <p>[EJLERT LÖVBORG <i>comes in from the hall; he is worn

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>George</i>. Welcome! (<i>Introduces him to</i> BRACK.)
    Listen&mdash;I have got your new book, but I haven't read it
    through yet.</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. You needn't&mdash;it's rubbish. (<i>Takes a
    packet of MSS. out.</i>) This <i>isn't</i>. It's in three
    parts; the first about the civilising forces of the future, the
    second about the future of the civilising forces, and the third
    about the forces of the future civilisation. I thought I'd read
    you a little of it this evening?</p>

    <p><i>Brack and George</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Awfully nice of
    you&mdash;but there's a little party this evening&mdash;so
    sorry we can't stop! Won't you come too?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. No, he must stop and read it to me and Mrs.
    ELVSTED instead.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. It would never have occurred to me to think
    of such clever things! Are you going to oppose me for the
    Professorship, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i> (<i>modestly</i>). No; I shall only triumph
    over you in the popular judgment&mdash;that's all!</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Oh, is that all? Fancy! Let us go into the
    back drawing-room and drink cold punch.</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. Thanks&mdash;but I am a reformed character,
    and have renounced cold punch&mdash;it is poison.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[GEORGE <i>and</i> BRACK <i>go into the back-room and

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i> (<i>slowly, in a low tone</i>). HEDDA GABLER!
    how <i>could</i> you throw yourself away like this!&mdash;Oh,
    is <i>that</i> the ORTLER Group? Beautiful!&mdash;Have you
    forgotten how we used to sit on the settee together behind an
    illustrated paper, and&mdash;yes, very picturesque
    peaks&mdash;I told you all about how I had been on the
    loose?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Now, none of that, here! These are the
    Dolomites.&mdash;Yes, I remember; it was a beautiful
    fascinating Norwegian intimacy&mdash;but it's over now. See, we
    spent a night in that little mountain village, TESMAN and
    I!</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. Did you, indeed? Do you remember that
    delicious moment when you threatened to shoot me
    down&mdash;(<i>tenderly</i>)&mdash;I do!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). Did I? I have done that to
    so many people. But now all that is past, and you have found
    the loveliest consolation in dear, good, little Mrs.
    ELVSTED&mdash;ah, here she is! (<i>Enter</i> Mrs. ELVSTED.)
    Now, THEA, sit down and drink up a good glass of cold punch.
    Mr. LÖVBORG is going to have some. If you don't, Mr. LÖVBORG,
    GEORGE and the Judge will think you are afraid of taking too
    much if you once begin.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, please, HEDDA! When I've inspired Mr.
    LÖVBORG so&mdash;good gracious! <i>don't</i> make him drink
    cold punch!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. You see, Mr. LÖVBORG, our dear little friend
    can't <i>trust</i> you!</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. So <i>that</i> is my comrade's faith in me!
    (<i>Gloomily.</i>) <i>I</i>'ll show her if I am to be trusted
    or not. (<i>He drinks a glass of punch</i>.) Now I'll go to the
    Judge's party. I'll have another glass first. Your health,
    THEA! So you came up to spy on me, eh? I'll drink the Sheriff's
    health&mdash;<i>everybody's</i> health!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He tries to get more punch.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>stopping him</i>). No more now. You are
    going to a party, remember. [GEORGE <i>and</i> TESMAN <i>come
    in from back-room.</i></p>

    <p><i>Lövborg.</i> Don't be angry, THEA. I was fallen for a
    moment. Now I'm up again! (Mrs. E. <i>beams with delight</i>).
    Judge, I'll come to your party, as you <i>are</i> so pressing,
    and I'll read GEORGE my manuscript all the evening. I'll do all
    in <i>my</i> power to make that party go!</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. No? fancy! that <i>will</i> be amusing!</p>

    But Mr. LÖVBORG must be back at ten, to take dear THEA
    home!</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>wearily</i>). Seven in the morning, and
    Mr. LÖVBORG not here to take me home <i>yet</i>! what
    <i>can</i> he be doing?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>yawning</i>). Reading to TESMAN, with
    vine-leaves in his hair, I suppose. Perhaps he has got to the
    third part.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, do you <i>really</i> think so, HEDDA? Oh,
    if I could but hope he was doing that!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. You silly little ninny! I should like to
    scorch your hair off. Go to bed! [Mrs. E. <i>goes. Enter</i>
    GEORGE.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. I'm a little late, eh? But we made
    <i>such</i> a night of it. Fancy! It was most amusing. EJLERT
    read his book to me&mdash;think of that! Astonishing book! Oh,
    we really had great fun! I wish <i>I'd</i> written it. Pity
    he's so irreclaimable.</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. I suppose you mean he has more of the courage
    of life than most people?</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Good Lord! He had the courage to get more
    drunk than most people. But, altogether, it was what you might
    almost call a Bacchanalian orgy. We finished up by going to
    have early coffee with some of these jolly chaps, and poor old
    LÖVBORG dropped his precious manuscript in the mud, and I
    picked it up&mdash;and here it is! Fancy if anything were to
    happen to it! He never could write it again. <i>Wouldn't</i> it
    be sad, eh? Don't tell anyone about it.</p>

        <p>[<i>He leaves the packet of MSS. on a chair, and rushes

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. <i>Another</i> early call, you see! My party
    was such a singularly animated <i>soirée</i> that I haven't
    undressed all night. Oh, it was the liveliest affair
    conceivable! And, like a true Norwegian host, I tracked LÖVBORG
    home; and it is only my duty, as a friend of the house, and
    cock of the walk, to take the first opportunity of telling you
    that he finished up the evening by coming to mere loggerheads
    with a red-haired opera-singer, and being taken off to the
    police-station! You mustn't have him here any more. Remember
    our little triple alliance!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>her smile fading away</i>). You are
    certainly a dangerous person&mdash;but you must not get a hold
    over me!</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>ambiguously</i>). What an idea! But I
    might&mdash;I am an insinuating dog. Good morning! [<i>Goes
    out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i> (<i>bursting in, confused and excited</i>). I
    suppose you've heard where <i>I've</i> been?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>evasively</i>). I heard you had a very
    jolly party at Judge BRACK's. [Mrs. ELVSTED <i>comes
    in.</i></p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. It's all over. I don't mean to do any more
    work. I've no use for a companion now, THEA. Go home to your
    Sheriff!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>agitated</i>). Never! I want to be with
    you when your book comes out!</p>

    <p><i>Lövborg</i>. It won't <i>come</i> out&mdash;I've torn it
    up! (<i>Mrs. E. rushes out, wringing her hands</i>.) Mrs.
    TESMAN, I told her a lie&mdash;but no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
       id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span> matter. I haven't torn my
       book up&mdash;I've done worse! I've taken it about to
       several parties, and it's been through a police-row with
       me&mdash;now I've lost it. Even if I found it again, it
       wouldn't be the same&mdash;not to me! I am a Norwegian
       literary man, and peculiar. So I must make an end of it
       altogether!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Quite so&mdash;but look here, you must do it
    beautifully. I don't insist on your putting vine-leaves in your
    hair&mdash;but do it beautifully. (<i>Fetches pistol.</i>) See,
    here is one of General GABLER's pistols&mdash;do it with

             alt="Summing Up." /></a>Summing Up.
    </div>

    <p>It may be remembered that (I trust) in deserved
    acknowledgment of my professional pre-eminence, I received,
    some little while ago, the appointment of a
    Deputy-Assistant-Revising-Barristership. In performing the
    duties of this important office, I sometimes have to incur
    bodily risk&mdash;the more especially when I have to
    distinguish between the rival claims of the political parties
    that I am sorry to say have made Lambville-cum-Minton the
    antithesis of heaven upon earth. On the occasion to which I
    particularly wish to refer, I was accompanied by my Wife, to my
    secret annoyance, as I am afraid the Lady who does me the
    honour to share my name is unduly apprehensive of my safety,
    and, besides this general plea, I had yet another special
    reason for desiring her absence. To tell the truth, I had been
    greatly moved by a decision given in the Court of Appeal,
    whereby it seemed to me (and no doubt to many of my learned
    friends) the custody of a wife by her husband had become an
    empty phrase, signifying nothing. I felt that if, by any means,
    I could get this judgment set aside, I would not only confer
    upon myself, as a married man, a signal benefit, but, moreover,
    as a Counsel, obtain increased professional distinction.
    However, I was embarrassed by the presence of my Wife, when I
    came to consider the best mode in which marital authority might
    be assumed to raise the question of the right of <i>habeas
    corpus</i>. I had returned to my room before the opening of the
    Registration Court at Lambville-cum-Minton, in rather a
    disturbed frame of mind. Truth to tell, my Wife, having learned
    that political feeling was rising so high in the town that it
    was possible that the Deputy-Assistant-Revising-Barrister might
    be assaulted by either or both of the rival factions, had done
    her best to dissuade me from taking my customary seat.</p>

    <p>"What shall I do, to say nothing of the darling children, if
    you are brought home on a hurdle?" she sobbed out.</p>

    <p>I assured her that there was a very remote risk of my
    succumbing to such a fate, as the conveyance home on a hurdle
    raised the presumption that the victim had been hunting, a
    sport in which I seldom, I may say, never indulged. But this
    explanation did not reassure her, and she left me in tears. Her
    emotion caused me much pain, the more especially as my proposed
    task seemed to me, under the circumstances, a species of
    domestic treason. However, I hardened my heart, and sat down to
    consider the facts of the case. To allow the right of seizure
    to be argued, it would be necessary to take my Wife out of the
    custody of someone other than myself. Her mother, a most
    estimable old lady, with whom I have had many a pleasant and
    exciting game of backgammon, seemed a right and proper person
    to assist me in carrying out my project. But the objection
    immediately occurred to me that it would be an exceedingly
    difficult matter to induce her to hold my Wife from me unless I
    desired her to take such a course. But if I made this request,
    would not the proceeding savour of collusion? To meet this
    obstacle I came to the conclusion that I might get my Wife to
    pay a visit to her mother, and then, appropriately disguised,
    seize and carry her off. By locking her in the conveyance and
    riding on the box, I could preserve my incognito until reaching
    home, and then I might confine her in her own room with assumed
    harshness, and possibly (of this I had some doubt) get her to
    complain of her imprisonment. By keeping my Wife's domicile a
    close secret, her mother would be induced to visit me to ask my
    professional assistance in recovering her daughter. Thus
    approached it would be possible to so advise the old lady that
    in the result she would demand my Wife's presence in Court
    under a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Then would come my
    opportunity. Of course I would produce my Wife, and having
    carefully prepared my arguments, would deliver an oration that
    would fill columns of the newspapers, and hand down my name to
    generations to come as <i>the</i> authority on marital rights.
    I saw in the near future wealth and restored domestic
    happiness. But the first thing to do was to lock up my Wife.
    And at this point it occurred to me that it was time for me to
    walk over to the Revision Court. I hastily gathered certain
    necessary articles into my brief-bag, and putting on my hat,
    grasped the handle of the door. To my surprise I found that I
    could obtain no egress. I rang the bell&mdash;and instead of a
    servant my Wife answered the summons. "The door is locked,
    dear," I observed, "and as the key seems to be on the other
    side, will you kindly open it, as I am in a hurry to be
    off."</p>

    <p>"You will stay where you are," was the reply. "You are not
    going to get killed by attending a nonsensical Revision
    Court."</p>

    <p>"But I must go," I explained; and then assuming a tone of
    authority I rarely adopt, I added, "and you will be good enough
    to open the door at once."</p>

    <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," replied my Wife, calmly.
    "I locked you in, and I shan't let you out."</p>

    <p>"What, Madam," I exclaimed; "do you defy my authority?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly!" was the immediate response, "You may say or
    think what you like, but you don't leave this house to-day as
    sure as I am your lawfully wedded Wife."</p>

    <p>And as a matter of fact I didn't!</p>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;To see MADAME ALBANI as <i>Violetta</i>
    the consumptive heroine of "<i>La Traviata</i>." Charmingly
    sung and admirably, nay, most touchingly, acted. MAUREL
    excellent as <i>Germont Senior</i>, and MONTARIOL quite the
    weak-minded masher <i>Alfredo</i>. What a different turn the
    story might have taken had it occurred to <i>Violetta</i> to
    have a flirtation with the handsome middle-aged <i>père
    noble</i>! At one time it almost seemed as if there had been
    some change in motive of the Opera since I last saw it, and
    that the above original idea was about to be carried out. But
    no; in another second <i>Germont-Maurel</i> as "Old Maurelity"
    (by kind permission of TOBY, M.P.) had pulled himself together,
    and <i>Albani-Violetta</i> was in the depths of remorseful
    sorrow. In that gay and festive supper scene, where a
    physician, unostentatiously styled <i>Il Dottore</i> (he would
    probably be <i>Ill</i> Dottore the morning after) is present to
    look after the health of the guests, and perhaps to "propose"
    it, I noticed with pleasure that, on the tables, DRURIOLANUS
    ALDERMANICUS, mindful of civic feasts, had placed bottles of
    real champagne, or at least real champagne-bottles. This
    interested the audience muchly, and numerous were the glasses
    turned in the direction of the bottles&mdash;of course 'tis
    opera-glasses I mean, yer honour,&mdash;in order to ascertain
    what particular wanity was <i>La Traviata's</i> favourite; but
    the bottles were so placed that only one unimportant word on
    the label was visible. Was it Pommery '80 <i>très
    sec</i>?&mdash;Or what was it? Impossible to see: it was not
    mentioned in the dialogue, so "Mumm" might have been the word.
    But at all events, if the wine is one which requires
    advertisement, the guests should be told to be very careful to
    leave the bottles in the same position as in the old prefatial
    stage-directions "the reader of the play" is supposed to be;
    <i>i.e.</i>, "<i>on the stage, facing the audience</i>."</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Rigoletto</i>. M. MAUREL as the
    Jester; acting good, voice too loud. ALBANI, as <i>Gilda</i>,
    overwhelmed with encores. M. MONTARIOL's <i>Il Duca</i> is
    <i>Alfredo</i> over again, only confirmed in a vicious career.
    To obtain an encore for the great but now hackneyed song,
    "<i>La Donna e mobile</i>," a wonderful rendering is absolutely
    essential, and somehow something seems wanting to the success
    of <i>Rigoletto</i> when this song goes for nothing and is
    passed without a rapturous "<i>bis, bis!</i>" which makes a
    Manager rub his hands and smilingly say to himself, "Good
    bis-ness."</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Lohengrin</i> I believe, but
    wasn't there. Hope the Opera went all right without me. Can't
    be in more places than one at the same moment. Same remarks
    apply to Friday and Saturday.</p>

    <h2>A BACONIAN THEORY;</h2>

    <h3>OR, TRYING IT ON.</h3>

    <p>SOLOMON isn't in it with Judge BACON. The point was whether
    Mrs. MANLEY had made Miss DOROTHY DENE's dresses to fit or not.
    "To fit or not to fit, that was the question." The Judge gave
    his decision after a fair trial of the two costumes&mdash;this
    might be remembered on both sides as "the trying-on
    case,"&mdash;that, according to the evidence of unimpeachable
    witnesses represented by the Judge's own common-sense and
    artistic eye for effect, two of the dresses and a cloak didn't
    fit, and that so far, the Defendant, Miss DOROTHY, must
    consider herself, in a dress-making sense, "non-suited." Mrs.
    MANLEY had, of course, undertaken to provide fits for her
    customers, and for having partially failed, her customers
    determined to return the compliment, by "giving <i>her</i>
    fits" if possible. So the parties came before Judge BACON, and
    appealed to His Honour. And the learned Judge mindful of
    ancestral Baconian wisdom, "<i>Cast a severe eye upon the
    example</i>"&mdash;that is, he examined the dresses most
    critically,&mdash;"<i>but a merciful eye upon the
    person</i>,"&mdash;for the fair Plaintiff and fair Defendant
    His Honour showed himself a most fair Judge, unwilling, as
    BACON, "to give beans" to either party, and so dismissing them
    with his beany-diction. But, <i>pauca verba</i>,&mdash;and may
    we always have nothing but praise to bestow on <i>Bacon's
    Essays</i>.</p>

    says, both for illigance and wariety, and, shoud I atemt to
    describe 'em, where on airth shoud I begin! But, as I must
    begin sumwheres, I hopes as I shan't awake the biling jealousy
    of all the other mothers present when I says as I gives the
    Parm Tree to the two rayther youthfool Beef Eaters. As for the
    number of Angels and Fairys, with most lovly wings, they was so
    numerus, and so bewtifool, that ewen I, a pore Hed Waiter,
    coudn't help the thort, that they was a giving me my first
    glimpse of Pairodice. Then again I noticed as the grashus and
    hansum LADY MARESS&mdash;who I should ha liked to ha seen
    putting herself at the hed of them all, and leading em all
    round the bewtifool All&mdash;had most kindly inwited a few
    poor creetures, such as nusses, and charity Gals, and plow
    boys, and setterer, just to let 'em see what they may sum day
    cum to be, if so be as they is all good.</p>

    <p>There was a lot of Hartists a going about makin skitches of
    the werry prettiest dresses insted of the werry prettiest
    faces, as I shood most suttenly have done. One of 'em wanted
    for to take my picter, but as I coudn't bleeve it was for my
    bewty, and was quite sure it wasn't for my full heavening
    dress, and coud therefore ony be for fun, I respekfully
    declined.</p>

    <p>"Oh Willow! Willow!" Mr. GRACE's memories of Forty years of
    Cricket are full of interest, of enthusiasm, and of good
    stories. "My Early Cricket Days" will hugely interest young
    would-be Willow-wielders. "Cricketers I have Met" is excellent
    reading, the Champion being as generous in appreciation as keen
    in judgment. On the science of the game he, of course, speaks
    as one having authority. THACKERAY said he never saw a boy
    without wishing to give him a sovereign. The "Co." for some
    time to come will not look on an athletic lad without longing
    to give him a copy of "Cricket; by W.G. GRACE." He hopes that
    lots of other "dasters" will feel the same yearning, and act
    upon it.</p>

    <p>One of the "Co." reports that he has been reading a work on
    <i>Decorative Electricity</i>, by Mrs. J.S.H. GORDON, and a
    very pretty and original little book he found it, full of
    suggestions, ingenious, fanciful, and practical, all at
    once&mdash;a rare combination. "Those about to"
    instal&mdash;and most of us will find ourselves in that
    position, sooner or later&mdash;will gain some invaluable hints
    and ideas from this volume, which, in addition to its other
    merits, is charmingly illustrated. Before very long we shall
    all be modern Aladdins, and summon our Slave of the Lamp as a
    matter of course. But there is plenty of scope for imagination
    in devising the form of his appearance, notwithstanding, and
    Mrs. GORDON's book shows us how the Genius may be compelled to
    present himself in a variety of pleasing and fantastic
    shapes.</p>

    <p>The Baron is of opinion that <i>The Seal of Fate</i>, by
    Lady POLLOCK and W.H. POLLOCK, is an interesting but somewhat
    discursive novel. Will it be followed by <i>The Fate of the
    Seal</i>, a tale of the Fishery Question?</p>

            <p>(You'll find him in <i>Bombastes</i>) and thought

            <p class="i2">Such rival Leos flourish,</p>

            <p class="i2">And mutual hatred nourish,</p>

            <p>With a snapping almost currish, upon Afric's

            <p class="i2">And in book and morning paper,</p>

            <p class="i2">They still clapperclaw and caper,</p>

            <p class="i2">When, with tempers hot as Indies,</p>

            <p class="i2">Heroes smash each other's windies,</p>

    <p>EARLY CLOSING MOVEMENT.&mdash;When Mr. SMITH proposed
    shutting up shop early on Tuesdays and Fridays, SIR ROBERT
    FOWLER was all for singing, "We won't go home till morning
    (<i>three times</i>), Till daylight doth appear." But, as
    <i>Falstaff</i> asks, "What doth gravity out of bed after
    midnight?" No, Sir ROBERT, doughty knight, take good advice,
    and hie thee, armed <i>Night-cap-à-pie</i>, to thy couch. Don't
    get up till morning, Till (long after) daylight doth
    appear!</p>

    <h3>THE PARTY PETER BELL.</h3>

            <p class="i2">In the green wood and hollow dell,</p>

            <p>And, upon April's nineteenth day,</p>

    <p>DISINFECTING THE WIGS.&mdash;"<i>L'Enfant Prodigue</i>,"
    which is filling the Prince of Wales's Theatre day and night,
    has much in it that is delightful. Perhaps there is nothing
    quite excels the subtle touch in the programme where it is
    written: "The theatre is disinfected by the Sanitas Company,
    Limited. <i>The Wigs by Clarkson</i>."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>CURIOUS, AND "MORE ANON!"&mdash;The <i>Evelyn</i> v.
    <i>Hurlbert</i> trial was as full of literary interest as a
    sale of old books and manuscripts. Specially valuable were
    copies of <i>Evelyn's Diary</i>; while, in spite of the
    pressing demand, <i>Murray's Memoirs</i> were uncommonly
    scarce. Victorious Mr. HURLBERT! Yet for all his triumph, he
    will be, for some time, a "very much Murray'd man."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A SAVOY QUESTION.&mdash;The general idea of the forthcoming
    new Opera at the Savoy appears to be "all Dance to SOLOMON's
    music." Is it to be a pantomime-drama, like <i>L'Enfant
    Prodigue</i>, or simply a ballet? If neither, where do
    song-words and dialogue come in?</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 20</i>.&mdash;The other
    week T.C. BARING was sitting among us, one of the Members for
    the City of London. Now BARING is no more, and to-night HUCKS
    GIBBS comes in to take his place. VICARY G. brought his father
    down; watched him take oath and has undertaken generally to see
    him through. In fact, when GIBBS <i>père</i> hesitated about
    taking the proffered seat for the City, VICARY undertook to
    fill it; finally, GIBBS <i>père</i> being warmly pressed,
    consented to sit, and VICARY stood aside. But he will come in
    by-and-by, when he has given his father a turn.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:27%;">
        <a href="images/216-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/216-1.png"
             alt="Late Member for the City." /></a>Late Member for
             the City.
    </div>

    <p>"Age before honesty, is my motto," said VICARY, when I
    complimented him upon the fine feeling he has shown throughout
    these negotiations. "I always think that we young fellows lose
    nothing by giving our elders a start. My father, you know,
    sometime ago wanted to change the name of our firm. Suggested
    it should be called SONS &amp; ANTONY GIBBS. There's something
    in it; but on the whole, better leave things as they are.
    ANTONY GIBBS &amp; SONS known all over the world; always
    embarrassing to change style of an old firm; so, for the
    present, at least, we leave things alone. Come along,
    <i>Pater</i>; think I'll take you home now. Never rush wildly
    into new engagements; you've had the excitement of being sworn
    in, and signing the roll of Parliament. You hadn't been in the
    place ten minutes before TIM HEALY gave you a chance of voting
    on a London City Bill, and that's enough for one night.
    By-and-by you shall stay all night and enjoy yourself in
    Committee on Irish Land Bill."</p>

    <p>So ANTONY GIBBS AND SON went off before dinner. Didn't miss
    much; grinding away at Irish Land Bill; most soul-depressing
    experience of modern life; no heart in it; no reality; SAGE of
    Queen Anne's Gate brings up amendment after amendment, and
    makes successive speeches; SEYMOUR KEAY does ditto;
    SHAW-LEFEVRE adds new terror to situation by taking voluminous
    notes which promise illimitable succession of orations; House
    empty; PRINCE ARTHUR has the full length of Treasury Bench on
    which to lounge. Occasionally Division-bell rings; Members
    troop in by the hundred; follow their leaders into Lobby right
    or left, deciding question they haven't heard debated, and mere
    drift of which two-thirds don't understand.</p>

    <p>BRER FOX absent to-night, which precludes possibility of
    flare-up in Irish Camp. TIM faithful to his post, but lacks
    inspiration of contiguity to BRER FOX.</p>

    <p>"PARNELL's played out," said TIM, referring in course of
    evening to BRER FOX's reception in his latest run through
    Ireland. "He may ramp and roar here, but his game's up in
    Ireland."</p>

    <p>"And is he resigned to the situation?" I asked.</p>

    <p>TIM looked at me, half winking his miraculously preserved
    right eye.</p>

    <p>"Did you ever hear, TOBY, what the weeping widow said to the
    parson, who asked, 'Was your husband resigned to die?' 'He had
    ter be,' she said, choking a sob."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Very little in the Irish Land
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. G.'s presence at Morning Sitting
    gave only possible fillip to interminable Debate on Land
    Purchase Bill. BRER FOX still away, so comparative peace reigns
    in Irish Camp. TIM HEALY no one to butt his head against;
    COLONEL NOLAN too busy deploying his army of five men; showing
    them how to retreat in good order when Division-bell rings, and
    how, when it is decided to vote, they shall pass out through
    one door, march in at the other, cross the floor, and look as
    much as possible as if they were ten instead of five. T.W.
    RUSSELL&mdash;"Roaring" RUSSELL, as his old colleague in
    Temperance fights, WILFRID LAWSON, calls him&mdash;frequently
    on his legs. At sound of his voice, Mr. G. gets his back up;
    interposes interjections and corrections; and presently, when
    he can stand it no longer, plunges into a speech.</p>

    <p>Another time SAUNDERSON draws him. "I am very sorry," said
    Mr. G., who has been itching to speak for last half-hour, "that
    the hon. and gallant Gentleman has dragged me into debate by
    gross misstatements."</p>

    <p>Being there, however, Mr. G. enjoys himself passably well,
    grinding SAUNDERSON to powder, and hewing RUSSELL to pieces
    before the Lord STRATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL, who are sleeping
    peacefully together in the Gallery. "Like the Babes in the
    Wood," said PLUNKET, looking up smilingly at the face in the
    Gallery, which looks twice as wise when asleep as the ordinary
    man does in full possession of his senses.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:27%;">
        <a href="images/216-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/216-2.png"
             alt="'Roaring' Russell." /></a>"Roaring" Russell.
    </div>

    <p>"I know," Mr. G. continued, in measured accents of polite
    scorn, "that the eloquence of the hon. and gallant Gentleman
    (meaning SAUNDERSON) is as ungovernable as I am afraid it is
    sometimes unprofitable. In the exercise of the understanding
    which the Almighty has given him, he has represented me as
    being a supporter of this Bill."</p>

    <p>Words cannot convey adequate impression of the subtlety of
    emotion conveyed by this unwonted, perhaps unprecedented,
    invocation. An unmistakeable, though unspoken, indication of
    mingled feeling&mdash;pity for one so meagrely endowed, and
    marvel that, out of boundless stores, the Deity could, even in
    this instance, have been so chary of gifts.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Still less in Committee on Irish
    Land Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Rival shows in both Houses to-night.
    Lords running the Newfoundland Delegates at the Bar; in the
    Commons Budget on. On the whole, Commons drew the fullest
    House, to which JOKIM descanted for nearly three hours. If he'd
    taken two, the speech would have been a third less long, and
    three times as successful. Still the Budget comes but once a
    year, and CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER feels bound to make the
    most of opportunity. Pretty plain sailing for first two hours.
    Then JOKIM ran aground. It was General STAMPS that did it all.
    Appeared unexpectedly in long list of details setting forth
    Estimates for Revenue in coming year. Nobody ever heard before
    of the General; thought, at least, he must belong to the Army
    Estimates. But JOKIM would have him in, spurs and epaulettes,
    and all.</p>

    <p>"General STAMPS," he said, regardless of grammar, "have
    fallen off." JOKIM, in his loose way, omitted to say off what;
    presumed to be his horse. House not sorry to hear it; had
    enough of the mysterious warrior. But he was up again a few
    minutes' later. "General STAMPS," JOKIM continued, in his airy
    fashion, "apart from the Death Duties, I reduce from £6,700,000
    to £5,900,000."</p>

    <p>"Better reduce him to the ranks at once," said Admiral
    FIELD, who is a terrible martinet.</p>

    <p>But JOKIM took no notice of the suggestion; floundered
    along, bungling terribly. Committee tried to help him out; that
    didn't help matters much. To have a Member in one part of the
    House filling up an awkward pause by suggesting "dried fruit,"
    another "coffee," a third "rum," and a fourth "probate duty,"
    when after all, JOKIM was thinking of the Income Tax or General
    STAMPS, evidently not designed to advance matters.</p>

    <p>"The Committee knows what I mean," JOKIM said, piteously,
    looking round out of a morass a little deeper than he'd been in
    lately. But that is exactly what the Committee didn't do.</p>

    <p>"Then," said JOKIM, "you'll understand the figures when you
    read them in the papers to-morrow." Something in that; House
    mollified; still can't help thinking that if it is to wait till
    next morning to read report of Chancellor's Budget Speech in
    order to understand his statements, some preliminary time might
    be saved in the evening.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget brought in.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Missed OLD MORALITY from Treasury
    Bench; looked in his room; found him in arm-chair, collapsed,
    by fire-place, with copy of <i>Morning Advertiser</i> in his
    hand.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" I asked. "Surely you've not been
    reading JOKIM's Budget Speech right through!" He certainly
    looked as if he had.</p>

    <p>"No, TOBY," he said; "it's not that; it's the Leader.
    Haven't you seen what the <i>Morning Advertiser</i> says about
    me? 'For the first time in our recollection he (that's me)
    bears on his political escutcheon a deep smudge of dishonour':
    and that's all because JOKIM wouldn't take a penny off a barrel
    of beer, and twopence off a gallon of spirits. It's the
    injustice I feel most acutely. It doesn't seem fair that Mr.
    BUNG should try to intimidate JOKIM by abusing me."</p>

    <p>"It <i>is</i> hard," I said; "but it's no use sitting moping
    here. Come along into House; they're in Committee on the Land
    Bill; an hour or two of that'll freshen you up." And it
    did.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
